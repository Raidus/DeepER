create hyperlinks for specific characters. in addition the application works better with text from other sources. the new character formatting docker makes formatting artistic and paragraph text easier than ever before. this convenient new docker includes easy-to-use controls for adjusting kerning changing the angle of selected characters and applying character effects such as underline strike-through uppercase. meanwhile an enhanced interactive fit text to path tool now makes it easier than ever to attach text to a path with precision. a common effect for creating logos and signs this new tool lets you interactively control text placement in order to get your desired results. new tools for illustration with coreldraw graphics suite x3 designers can take advantage of tons of new tools and features that increase their productivity without compromising on their creativity and flexibility. for instance the new star tool lets users quickly and easily draw perfect stars while the new complex star tool makes it easy to create complex stars that have intersecting sides and produce unique results with an applied fill. you can also specify the number of points and can sharpen the points of a complex star. a significant time-saver the new crop tool quickly lets you remove unwanted areas in objects and imported graphics -- both bitmap and vector. this handy addition to the coreldraw x3 toolbox eliminates the need to ungroup objects break linked groups apart or convert objects to curves. meanwhile the unique new smart fill tool lets you apply a fill to any enclosed area by creating a new object from an enclosed area. unlike conventional fill tools that fill only objects the smart fill tool detects the edges of an area and creates a closed path so that the area can be filled. for example the smart fill tool can fill the loops of a freehand line that crosses over itself. the smart fill tool creates a path around the area so the filled object can be moved copied or edited. powerful accurate tracing coreldraw graphics suite x3 provides a more streamlined integrated tracing solution that delivers accurate and optimized bitmap-to-vector tracing results. integrated with coreldraw x3 the new corel powertrace allows users to quickly and easily convert bitmaps into editable vector graphics. design professionals typically face the challenge of turning bitmap images into high-quality vector images to create logos for business cards brochures signs and promotional items. for control and flexibility corel powertrace generates a color palette that lets you easily pick which colors appear in the traced result and quickly convert them to the appropriate color mode including spot colors. you can also choose from several preset tracing styles color modes and background options. with three different preview modes -- before and after large preview and wireframe overlay -- corel powertrace makes it easy to analyze the result and adjust the settings used to trace your image. efficient photo editing coreldraw graphics suite x3 puts the focus on providing design professionals with more efficient intuitive and accurate photo editing. corel photo-paint x3 is now significantly faster when working with large images and applying photo effects resulting in better real-time feedback and improving overall workflow efficiency. improved object handling gives designers more precise control in rotating skewing or distorting objects. for large images improved use of image cache provides significantly increased response time for previewing most effects and for manipulating objects. the new integrated image adjustment lab saves designers valuable time and is accessible from both corel photo-paint and coreldraw. design professionals often work with files that have poor color balance and contrast and they need to use multiple tools to make adjustments. the image adjustment lab addresses this problem by uniting a number of manual and automatic controls for common color and tone corrections providing an intuitive and fast way to achieve professional image adjustments. the image adjustment lab also lets users create snapshots of their adjustments with just one click. the snapshots appear below the working preview which lets users easily compare each snapshot against the original and choose the best result. built on the power of corel knockout the enhanced cutout lab includes new controls to simplify the process of cutting out image areas and to improve accuracy. the new add detail and remove detail tools make it easy to refine the cutout area. for easy reference when defining the cutout area users can preview their cutout against the original image or transparent white gray or black backgrounds. for maximum flexibility users can choose to save the cutout object and discard the original image save the cutout object and keep the original image or save the cutout object as a clip mask added to the original image. in addition the cutout lab includes undo and redo buttons to quickly correct any mistakes. enhanced compatibility coreldraw graphics suite x3 provides enhanced compatibility for more than 100 commonly used file formats including adobe illustrator photocells corel paint shop pro microsoft office jpeg and pdf. users can now seamlessly edit and exchange files in those formats. outstanding support for spot colors has been added for adobe illustrator photoshop and pdf. upgrade eligibility to purchase the upgrade version of coreldraw graphics suite x3 you must own a previous licensed version of: coreldraw coreldraw

1,world of warcraft expansion: burning crusade,blizzard entertainment took online role playing by storm with their hit title world of warcraft. with mind-boggling improvements in graphics gameplay networking and interface -- really every category -- this game became the crown prince of the genre. world of warcraft players will be excited by the approaching release of the new expansion pack: world of warcraft: the burning crusade. this pack expands the already massive award-winning multiplayer online role-playing game by tremendous bounds adding new races lands battlegrounds professions and items and much much more. although no release date has been set here is sample of what you can expect from the burning crusade. the burning crusade is the highly anticipated unreleased expansion pack for blizzard's world of warcraft. what lies in medivh's tower? view larger. blood elves emerge as a new race in the burning crusade. view larger. the blood elves seek the golden destiny that has been promised to them. view larger. warcraft's newest continent: outland. view larger. once a beautiful land outland has been ravaged by war. view larger. outland is a vital strategic location. view larger. the expansion pack features an increase in the level cap to 70. there are two new playable races including the magical blood elves that you can read more about below. the other race has not yet been released by blizzard. there will be new starting zones in quel'thalas and beyond. another eye-opening addition is the entirely new unexplored continent of outland that is reachable through the dark portal. plus you'll find many new high-level dungeons to explore in azeroth outland and elsewhere that will substantially boost gameplay. there are new flying mounts in outland; tons of new and dangerous monsters (including epic world bosses); hundreds of new quests and items; and even a new profession: jewelcrafting. of course this isn't the end of the list -- this is just a glimpse of what blizzard has planned for their unreleased expansion pack. the new story the rumors and more several years have passed since the burning legion's defeat at mount hyjal and the races of azeroth have continued to rebuild their once shattered lives. with renewed strength the heroes of the horde and alliance have begun to explore new lands and have broken through the dark portal to investigate the realms beyond the known world. in this expansion pack the burning crusade refers to the burning legion's ongoing efforts to destroy life on azeroth. to date the burning legion's exploits have been documented in warcraft iii and in the war of the ancients novel trilogy. as part of the expansion pack players will now be able to travel through the dark portal to confront the legion on otherworldly battlefields. although only one race has been revealed blizzard has announced plans to unveil details about possible additional races at a later date. on the other hand many details have been released about the new continent outland. players last visited outland in warcraft iii: the frozen throne alongside illidan as he conquered the pit lord magtheridon's domain. players will also gain access to quel'thalas the region to the northeast of the forsaken lands where the blood elves reside. blizzard says that this expansion pack holds even more new areas that are ripe for player exploration -- additional details will be revealed in the months ahead. blizzard also has plans to add new dungeons and battlegrounds with the expansion though the exact number has not yet been determined. one upcoming dungeon that has players excited is karazhan which is located within medivh's tower. because medivh has played such a central role in warcraft lore blizzard is convinced that longtime players will be especially interested in seeing what karazhan contains. as for battlegrounds blizzard has released very little information. however they have announced plans to make some of the battles from the past accessible through the caverns of time. blood elves: the new race thousands of years ago the exiled highborne landed on the shores of lordaeron and founded the enchanted kingdom of quel'thas. these high elves as they called themselves created a fountain of vast magical energies within the heart of their land -- the sunwell. over time they grew dependant on the sunwell's unstable energies regardless of the bitter lessons they'd learned in ages past. during the third war the villainous prince arthas invaded quel'thalas and reduced the once-mighty realm to rubble and ashes. his undead army decimated nearly all of the high elven population. in addition he used the sunwell's energies to resurrect a powerful undead lich kel'thuzad thereby fouling the sunwell's mystical waters. the few elven survivors realizing that they had been cut off from the source of their arcane power grew increasingly volatile and desperate. in the midst of the elves' darkest hour came kael'thas sunstrider the last of quel'thalas' royal bloodline. kael as he was commonly known knew that the remnant of his people would not long survive without the nourishing magic that once empowered them. renaming his people blood elves in honor of their fallen countrymen kael taught the survivors how to tap into ambient mystical energies -- even demonic energies -- in order to sate their terrible thirst for magic. in search of a new destiny for his people kael'thas ventured to the remote world of outland where he encountered the fallen night elf illidan. under illidan's watchful eye kael and his blood elves regained much of their former power. unfortunately the blood elves practice of embracing demonic energies caused their former comrades in the alliance to shun them. thus the remaining blood elves on azeroth look desperately to the horde to help them reach outland where they can reunite with kael'thas and achieve the golden destiny he has promised them. outland: the new continent once the beautiful homeworld of the orcs all that remains of draenor is the scattered wastes of outland. following the second war the alliance invaded draenor by crossing through the dark portal. to their horror they discovered that ner'zhul -- the dark warlord of horde -- had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten horde to newer unspoiled worlds. as the alliance forces closed in around him ner'zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. however his plan backfired and the gateway's clashing energies resulted in a massive catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of draenor to pieces. nearly thirteen years later -- towards the end of the third war -- the fallen night elf illidan discovered that huge chunks of draenor still existed floating upon the astral winds of the twisting nether. after his defeat at the hands of the evil prince arthas illidan fled to the remnants of draenor and dubbed them outland. he quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of ner'zhul's gateways. though he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies -- most notably arthas the new lich king and the remaining lords of the burning legion. for now outland is home to a number of scattered draenei tribes primitive orcs and powerful arcane creatures of the nether itself. agents of the burning legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending burning crusade to scour all life from the universe. what else can expected? blizzard has tantalized warcraft players with the brief glimpse into the burning crusade's storyline. will these heroes find friends or foes? what dangers and rewards lie in wait beyond the dark portal? and what will they do when they discover that the demons they thought were vanquished have returned to renew their terrible burning crusade? these and other questions will remain unanswered until the gameplay can be explored by role-playing warcrafters.,blizzard entertainment,39.99,world of warcraft burning crusade,,,39.99,b000bwzy7q#http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/1759747759895818218

characters to grease your animation wheels and get a feel for the software's capabilities. this program includes everything aspiring artists need to create top quality animations from start to finish -- it simplifies the animation process and empowers artists to create their projects faster and easier than ever before. you'll be surprised by how quickly you can get started. packed with ready-to-use anime style characters you can create your own animations right out of the box. tutorials and sample files show you how to maximize anime studio pro's powerful features giving you the jump start you'll need to begin your first project. once you feel at home with the mechanics of the software you'll be ready to move on to your own art. sketch your original characters and backdrops scan in and import graphics or if you use a pen tablet you can recreate the sensation of drawing on paper. built with vector graphics anime studio pro 5 provides power and flexibility with multiple layering and the capacity to resize images without sacrificing quality. another powerful element of anime studio pro 5 is the use of bones. using the software's bone rigging system you can add a skeleton to any image to bring it to life. with anime studio pro 5 there is no need to create new art for each individual frame as you animate -- just adjust the bones to your desired position and the program will generate the movement for you. you can also count on anime studio pro 5 to help direct your animated action with an intuitive timeline. setting your movements to a timeline makes scene changes feel seamless and natural so the plot of your animated short is easier to follow. no animation is complete without an audio soundtrack. anime studio pro 5 helps you add emotion and style to your animations by adding sound in wav and aiff formats. and once you've completed a project you can publish your results for a variety of media including video tv and web formats. design and layout anime studio pro 5 gives you total control over your canvas and makes it easy for you to organize and complete your project using layers. with this intuitive software under your belt you can set up your 2d canvas to the exact dimensions you want. and with anime studio pro you can even turn your canvas into a 3d stage with x y and z coordinates to easily produce your animation with added depth and dimension. using anime studio pro's vector-based graphics you can freely adjust canvas resolution and size without losing image quality. if you're already accustomed to other graphics-driven programs such as photoshop or quark you'll be pleased with anime studio pro's familiar layer-based workflow. it is an easy and efficient way to organize your assets and create your animation and you'll save time by reusing your art. simply create an asset once and place it on a layer then refer to that layer any time you need to reuse a piece of art. advanced layer features include switch layers which allows you to rotate among all the layers in a set and shows only one layer a time. this saves you a great deal of time when animating body movements or facial expressions. use anime studio pro to rig your characters objects and scenes with the revolutionary bone system that makes the animation process easier than ever before. bones create a skeleton that determines joints or flex points in your artwork. you can then manipulate the bones to move the image into new positions without time-consuming redraws. simple tools let you design dynamic character movement. stop thinking of your drawings as fixed static images -- with anime studio pro you drawings become like soft rubber with stiff wires inside that help you move and position the objects on the screen. bones are never displayed in the final render they're just used as a tool during the animation process. and to make the process smoother and easier to follow you can organize your project using keyframe animation and a timeline. then all you need to do is position your image on the canvas and manipulate the timeline. the software will interpolate the motion between positions for you to create a smooth-flowing graceful transition from one movement to the next. in anime studio pro you can also fine tune your animations with powerful timeline controls such as onion skins tweening and graph mode. and with the pro version you can create animations of any length. once you complete a project you can finish it for web tv film and still formats. with anime studio pro you can output your finished work to a variety of standard formats such as avi mov and flash (swf export for vector based animations). studio pro also makes it easy to transfer your work to other popular graphics programs to utilize assets for other projects or to add color to your art. pro exports to jpg bmp png an tga file formats and even allows you to export your artwork as layered psd files. animation techniques traditional animation was created by drawing frames one after another each frame drawn slightly different from the last. anime studio pro helps you simulate frame-by-frame animation yet drastically reduces the time required from traditional animation. designed to mimic real skeletal structure the anime studio pro bones are interdependent so when you adjust one bone all the other connected bones will move in response. the bone-rigging feature also uses spring-like simulation to calculate dynamic bone movement. this makes a wide range of movements seem real such as jumping waving flabby body parts and bouncing hair. you can also take advantage of anime studio pro's switch layers function to work with a combination of connected movements that occur along a timeline. this is particularly valuable for animating body movements or facial expressions such as lip-synch animations when each graphical layer can be a mouth shape for a different sound. an additional animation feature includes cycling keyframe interpolation which will automatically cycle a section of animation and repeat it over again as many times as you wish. another feature includes onion skins that show the position of objects in your scene at a given point in time -- just click on any point in the timeline to see the onion skins in anime studio pro. in anime studio pro you can use actions -- little clips of animation that are associated with a layer or group of layers -- to create reusable animations for movements that you expect to use repeatedly. tweening adjusts the pace of movements within a given action so you can slow it down or speed it up. and pro's graph mode allows you to inspect an animation curve plotted as values on a graph. this helps evaluate acceleration changes in direction and other properties of motion. anime studio pro includes over 200 sample files and is filled with content that includes the standard anime studio content files such as anime characters aya and winsor backgrounds animation other characters scenery and props. anime studio pro also includes extra samples such as 3d animals 3d movies and samples provided by users that serve as great starting points.,efrontier,199.99,allume

from around the world to create the next-generation art studio. providing an experience that is unmatched by any other software corel painter has grown to become the world's most powerful painting & illustration application. artists designers and photographers continue to enjoy many features that have been the cornerstones of this ground-breaking application for years. the following features let creative professionals leverage their natural talents and techniques to create original works of art distinguishing corel painter from other applications. brushes brushes have always been the heart and soul of corel painter. there are more than 30 brush categories ranging from crayons chalk and charcoal to acrylics watercolor liquid ink artists' oils and the new realbristle. while most brush categories mirror the look and feel of traditional brushes others offer users a one-of-a-kind creative tool. brushes are organized into distinct categories each featuring a multitude of variants. the following brush categories are just a sample of those available to corel painter x customers. artists' oils painting system: the artists' oils painting system enables users to apply paint blends created in the mixer palette directly onto images in the document window. each brush dab loads the brush variant with a finite amount of oil. as the oil runs out the brush stroke becomes fainter. brush strokes interact with any paint already on the canvas just as they would with natural media. watercolor: watercolor brush variants produce natural-looking watercolor effects. almost all brush variants in the watercolor category interact with the canvas texture. for most of these variants stylus pressure affects the width of the brush stroke. as with traditional-media watercolor brushes greater pressure on the brush widens a stroke and less pressure narrows a stroke. chalk: chalk brush variants produce the thick rich texture of natural chalk sticks and cover with strokes that interact with the paper grain. the opacity is linked to stylus pressure. image hose: the image hose behaves like a brush but it sprays images instead of applying paint. users can also load their own image or select from the library included in the application. cloners: painting with a cloner brush is similar to painting with any corel painter brush except that cloner brush variants take their color information from a clone source such as a pattern or another image instead of from the colors palette. some cloner brush variants reproduce a source image directly. other cloner brush variants reproduce a source image with low opacity and soft edges or use paper grain and specialized dabs for particular media effects. brush controls brush control palettes provide quick easy access to all brush settings and controls. making on-the-fly changes to brush settings and variables is as simple as dragging a slider�& 128;without any disruption to workflow. for example the boost slider found in the general palette of the brush controls instantly enhances brush speed. just drag the slider and see brush performance accelerate. gitanjali rao's printed rainbow animated film. winner of three best short film awards at cannes 2006 including the kodak discovery award�& 128;best short film; the young critics award�& 128;best short film; and the rail d'or�& 128;best short film. www.printedrainbow.com textures in the traditional art world an artist's brush or drawing tool produces different results when applied to surfaces with different textures. corel painter allows users to control the texture of the canvas to achieve the results they would expect from conventional art media on a given surface. brushes interact with paper grain just as natural tools react with the texture of the surfaces beneath them. textures can also be used to create special effects such as rusted metal on an intergalactic spaceship or bark on a tree. animation corel painter has an impressive array of animation features. the onion skinning feature enables users to view previous and future frames while working on the current frame. the rotoscoping feature enables users to paint and modify a single frame of an existing movie. animated movies can be saved as animated gifs quicktime movies or avi movies. support for industry-standard file formats corel painter lets users open

1,microsoft windows xp professional upgrade with sp2,with windows xp professional edition with service pack 2 you get safer browsing and communication powerful security tools and improved experiences. windows xp is the operating system release that unifies the microsoft range with all the desktop versions now built on the nt/2000 code base rather than the shakier foundation of windows 95 98 and me. that makes xp a great upgrade for users of the now-obsolete 9x and me line but for those already on windows 2000 professional it is a closer call. despite the similar name there is no special synergy between windows xp and office xp which works fine on windows 2000. the security center lets you check the status of your essential security settings. xp certainly looks different with rounded window corners larger and more detailed icons and a clean-look desktop that on first installation shows only the taskbar and recycle bin. xp is also more customizable than earlier versions of windows and includes visual themes that let you change the whole appearance of windows in an instant. that is the window-dressing but underneath are some significant improvements. one of the most interesting is remote desktop. a standard xp feature this uses technology from microsoft terminal server to enable users to access their computer over any connection; for example by dialing into the office from home. this is not just file access--this technology lets you run applications remotely as if you were sitting at your desk at work. this is mature technology stable and carefully thought out. so for example you can print from a remote word processor to a local printer. a variation on the theme is remote assistance where the user can allow a remote helper to view their desktop or optionally gain control of the keyboard and mouse in order to troubleshoot a problem. the feature can also be disabled to ease security concerns. laptop users benefit from enhanced power management with options to extend battery life by reducing cpu speed and display brightness. irda support has been fixed so that unlike windows 2000 windows xp can easily use modems in mobile telephones via infrared. a new screen font cleartype improves legibility for laptop or other flat screens and there is built-in support for wireless networking using the popular 802.11 standard. a great feature of xp also found in windows 2000 is the ability to synchronize network files with offline copies. previously these files could not be stored securely but now they can be encrypted. the information bar in windows xp home edition with service pack 2 notifies you when it blocks activex control or active content and then lets you decide what to do. for web browsing xp comes with internet explorer 6.0. the enhancements in ie 6.0 are mainly of interest to web developers and in any case microsoft makes ie freely available to all windows users. although java is not installed by default it is not difficult to download a java virtual machine (jvm). windows messenger originally a chat client has evolved into a collaboration tool that allows for video conferencing and application sharing. service pack 2 allows users to instruct internet explorer how to handle downloads from a specific publisher the most significant new feature for internet users is the built-in firewall. a firewall protects against one of the most disturbing security risks in which other users unknown to you might connect to your computer while it is online reading private files or causing other damage. xp's built-in firewall is a simple affair but it does prevent most types of unauthorized connection. windows xp has strong multimedia features. the new media player lets you copy music from cd to hard disk create your own playlist and write your own music cds if you have a cd writer. although there is loss of quality as a result of compression the process is easy and convenient. media player 8.0 can play back dvd video but only if a hardware or software dvd decoder is already installed. you can also play mp3 audio files and mpeg videos but sadly not the popular realmedia formats. in the end media player does nothing that you cannot also do with free alternatives but it is slick and nicely integrated. the xp user interface is not a radical departure from earlier versions of windows but there are a number of small changes that together add up to a significant improvement. the start menu now automatically features the most frequently used programs at the top of the list and you can add and remove shortcuts by right-clicking the icon and selecting pin or unpin from the pop-up menu. windows online help is integrated into a help and support center that works like an internal web site with searchable help tutorials and walk-throughs. windows xp professional includes all the features of windows xp home and adds support for dual processors encryptable file systems offline folders the remote desktop as described above and extra administration features that come into play when connected to a windows server domain. xp is demanding on hardware and it would be a mistake to install it on less than microsoft's recommended minimum requirements. there is also activation to consider a mildly annoying anti-piracy measure that requires you to obtain a code from microsoft for full installation and in the future if you reinstall or make major system changes. windows xp service pack 2 features internet explorer pop-up blocker makes browsing the internet more enjoyable by enabling you to reduce unwanted ads and content. internet explorer download monitoring warns you about potentially harmful downloads and gives you the option to block files that could be malicious. internet explorer information bar provides better information about events that are happening as you browse the web so it& 8217;s easier to know what& 8217;s going on and address potential security issues. windows security center allows you to easily view your security status and manage key security settings in one convenient place. windows firewall update automatically turned on by default this improved firewall helps protect windows xp from viruses worms and other security threats that can spread over the internet. improved wireless support dramatically improves and simplifies the process of discovering and connecting to wireless networks. bluetooth technologies enables you to easily connect to the latest bluetooth-enabled hardware devices such as keyboards cell phones and pdas. windows

paper notebooks file folders and printouts. save time by consolidating information taking notes on paper and transcribing them later can be time-consuming and difficult and you run the risk of losing important pages. in addition it's difficult to share data kept in a conventional paper notebook and they're only good for capturing one kind of information: handwritten notes. when it's time to gather information from other sources and in different ways other difficulties can arise. for instance because most people don't have a way of digitally capturing unstructured information they often print out web research and store information in file folders or on desks which is difficult to find later and inaccessible when you're away. and sharing information with others can be challenging--even when using e-mail it can be hard to hard to figure out what the plan is without reading through long e-mail threads that may or may not contain the information you need. onenote 2007 however gives you a

subsequent meetings. you can also catch all the details of customer calls and meetings by synchronizing typed or handwritten notes with office onenote 2007 audio and video recordings. if you're

visually rich icons that make it easier to return to reminders to-dos and other action items. work together more effectively with team members working from different locations and on multiple projects communication coordination and information sharing can challenge group effectiveness and productivity. teams often rely on e-mail messages to share information causing confusion and bloated e-mail inboxes. tasks action items agendas and issues stored within static documents or document management systems are difficult to update track and access and they prevent multiple people from working with the same information at the same time. onenote 2007 helps people work together better by eliminating roadblocks that arise when information is isolated in paper notes or file folders or on one person's computer. groups can share information easily work more productively and keep track of projects issues and goals more effectively. individuals can work together from the same

knowledge base so that everyone has access to the same information helping to get new team members up to speed quickly and minimizing duplicate efforts. share notes even with non-onenote 2007 users by sending your notes as html so that anyone with an e-mail client or web browser can view them and stay in control of your information by choosing which notebooks to share with your teammates and which to keep private and help ensure privacy with password protection. you can even use onenote 2007 as a shared digital whiteboard enabling virtual teams to work together in real time viewing and editing

1,microsoft windows xp professional full version with sp2,with windows xp professional edition with service pack 2 you get safer browsing and communication powerful security tools and improved experiences. windows xp is the operating system release that unifies the microsoft range with all the desktop versions now built on the nt/2000 code base rather than the shakier foundation of windows 95 98 and me. that makes xp a great upgrade for users of the now-obsolete 9x and me line but for those already on windows 2000 professional it is a closer call. despite the similar name there is no special synergy between windows xp and office xp which works fine on windows 2000. the security center lets you check the status of your essential security settings. xp certainly looks different with rounded window corners larger and more detailed icons and a clean-look desktop that on first installation shows only the taskbar and recycle bin. xp is also more customizable than earlier versions of windows and includes visual themes that let you change the whole appearance of windows in an instant. that is the window-dressing but underneath are some significant improvements. one of the most interesting is remote desktop. a standard xp feature this uses technology from microsoft terminal server to enable users to access their computer over any connection; for example by dialing into the office from home. this is not just file access--this technology lets you run applications remotely as if you were sitting at your desk at work. this is mature technology stable and carefully thought out. so for example you can print from a remote word processor to a local printer. a variation on the theme is remote assistance where the user can allow a remote helper to view their desktop or optionally gain control of the keyboard and mouse in order to troubleshoot a problem. the feature can also be disabled to ease security concerns. laptop users benefit from enhanced power management with options to extend battery life by reducing cpu speed and display brightness. irda support has been fixed so that unlike windows 2000 windows xp can easily use modems in mobile telephones via infrared. a new screen font cleartype improves legibility for laptop or other flat screens and there is built-in support for wireless networking using the popular 802.11 standard. a great feature of xp also found in windows 2000 is the ability to synchronize network files with offline copies. previously these files could not be stored securely but now they can be encrypted. the information bar in windows xp professional edition with service pack 2 notifies you when it blocks activex control or active content and then lets you decide what to do. for web browsing xp comes with internet explorer 6.0. the enhancements in ie 6.0 are mainly of interest to web developers and in any case microsoft makes ie freely available to all windows users. although java is not installed by default it is not difficult to download a java virtual machine (jvm). windows messenger originally a chat client has evolved into a collaboration tool that allows for video conferencing and application sharing. service pack 2 allows users to instruct internet explorer how to handle downloads from a specific publisher the most significant new feature for internet users is the built-in firewall. a firewall protects against one of the most disturbing security risks in which other users unknown to you might connect to your computer while it is online reading private files or causing other damage. xp's built-in firewall is a simple affair but it does prevent most types of unauthorized connection. windows xp has strong multimedia features. the new media player lets you copy music from cd to hard disk create your own playlist and write your own music cds if you have a cd writer. although there is loss of quality as a result of compression the process is easy and convenient. media player 8.0 can play back dvd video but only if a hardware or software dvd decoder is already installed. you can also play mp3 audio files and mpeg videos but sadly not the popular realmedia formats. in the end media player does nothing that you cannot also do with free alternatives but it is slick and nicely integrated. the xp user interface is not a radical departure from earlier versions of windows but there are a number of small changes that together add up to a significant improvement. the start menu now automatically features the most frequently used programs at the top of the list and you can add and remove shortcuts by right-clicking the icon and selecting pin or unpin from the pop-up menu. windows online help is integrated into a help and support center that works like an internal web site with searchable help tutorials and walk-throughs. windows xp professional includes all the features of windows xp home and adds support for dual processors encryptable file systems offline folders the remote desktop as described above and extra administration features that come into play when connected to a windows server domain. xp is demanding on hardware and it would be a mistake to install it on less than microsoft's recommended minimum requirements. there is also activation to consider a mildly annoying anti-piracy measure that requires you to obtain a code from microsoft for full installation and in the future if you reinstall or make major system changes. windows xp service pack 2 features internet explorer pop-up blocker makes browsing the internet more enjoyable by enabling you to reduce unwanted ads and content. internet explorer download monitoring warns you about potentially harmful downloads and gives you the option to block files that could be malicious. internet explorer information bar provides better information about events that are happening as you browse the web so it& 8217;s easier to know what& 8217;s going on and address potential security issues. windows security center allows you to easily view your security status and manage key security settings in one convenient place. windows firewall update automatically turned on by default this improved firewall helps protect windows xp from viruses worms and other security threats that can spread over the internet. improved wireless support dramatically improves and simplifies the process of discovering and connecting to wireless networks. bluetooth technologies enables you to easily connect to the latest bluetooth-enabled hardware devices such as keyboards cell phones and pdas. windows media player 9 series makes it easy to enjoy music video and broadband content with enhanced security.,microsoft,299.99,microsoft windows xp pro oem sp2 no open box returns,please note: this
