instead the game allows you to customize your character's proficiencies and make dramatic changes to your skill set on the fly. also each character's set of statistics such as perception and belief predispose them toward one style of play or another. gameplay is primarily turn-based combat that occurs during randomly generated missions in search of targets or objects. you earn currency experience points and loot (such as weapons and other items) from accomplishing missions and defeating opponents. many missions have multiple stages and while it's possible to finish them on your own it's much more efficient to plow through them with a group of other players. the matrix online allows players to form groups of up to a dozen called crews that are more permanent in nature and multiple crews can come together to form a faction. in addition to fighting foes using hand-to-hand combat guns and viruses characters can create useful items by compiling them. one of the most enticing aspects of the matrix online is the promise of an evolving storyline that develops based on each players' actions ensuring that you will keep coming back not just for the thrill of the game but in order to see how the story turns out. both everquest games -- evolution and everquest ii -- take place in the world of norrath. view larger. everquest: evolution and everquest ii as the game that originally helped create the market for the massive multiplayer online role-playing genre the everquest line of role-playing games require little explanation. both everquest games -- evolution and everquest ii -- take place in the world of norrath but in everquest ii norrath has been stricken by a cataclysmic event that caused civilization to virtually collapse leaving only two main metropolises intact. in both evolution and everquest ii you must choose your character's race profession and alignment before you head out in to the world to gain experience win renown and hopefully become rich and powerful beyond your wildest dreams. everquest: evolution features the original game plus all of the expansion packs released so far including the ruins of kunark the scars of velious the shadows of luclin the planes of power and the legacy of ykesha. everquest ii includes the new world order a ton of original content breathtaking new graphics and several tweaks to gameplay such as a purely player-versus-environment gameplay design that removes the original everquest's option of attacking other players. as one of the most participated in and deeply developed massively-multiplayer online games ever created both everquest: evolution and everquest ii will provide you with virtually endless entertainment and challenges.,sony creative software,29.99,sony pc video game - the station access collection - dvd-rom,super fast shipping - platinum reseller ratings - over 12 years in business,,4.99,b000edvrtq#http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/14326164391298371952

0,punch! professional home design,punch professional home design suite does something very few home planning applications achieve: it brings together designing both the interior and the exterior--including the garden--of your home on one cd-rom. while the software is perhaps a bit complex to learn at first the huge range of features offered make this forgivable. you can start with a blank screen work with a pre-drawn plan from the software's library or import scans of the existing floor plans of your home. whichever option you choose simply clicking the onscreen tabs allows you to switch between working on the floor plans electrical plans the plumbing system roofing arrangements heating and air conditioning external decking or landscaping. getting objects such as furniture into position on a plan is mostly a matter of drag and drop while you can also use a computer aided design feature to draw curves arcs and other standard shapes. it is useful to be able to see a flat plan and a 3-d view side by side and to walk through the 3-d view or do a flyover. you can even change the light direction intensity and brightness on the 3-d views to get as close to the real world as possible. with several useful tools above and beyond the designer punch professional home design suite is a rounded application. the 3-d furniture workshop lets you edit the library of furniture objects or design your own from scratch. realmodel lets you turn a home plan into a template for making a scale model--you can even print textures onto paper for pasting to the building materials. homeestimator works out how much it will cost to build your project life-size and how much of each type of material you need. --sandra vogel,punch! software,89.99,brighter minds land before time: kindergarten,minimum requirements: macintosh minimums: os 8.6 - 9.2.2 266mhz powerpc osx in classic mode 32mb free ram 32mb free hard drive space 8x cd-rom drive 16-bit color video card 800 x 600 resolution mouse or other pointing device,,9.99,b00004ochi#http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/2604592440966815556

0,rollercoaster tycoon 3 (mac),released back in 1999 the original rollercoaster tycoon took the gaming world by surprise managing to capture the attention of both hardcore gamers and casual novices alike. rollercoaster tycoon 3 not only contains all of the same charm and joy of the original but wraps it up in a spectacular three-dimensional package. you can now rotate the camera and zoom in and out which allows you to more clearly see where a new ride will be placed and exactly how it will fit in your park. the 3d rendering also shows height and depth which isn't just a superfluous change but really assists you when building custom attractions. who knew that constructing and running an amusement park could be so much fun? now for the first time you can build operate and attend the amusement park of your dreams in rollercoaster tycoon 3. take a front row seat on any of your rides and zoom along with a pal. view larger. and speaking of the pals -- they are completely personalized with unique facial expressions and behaviors. view larger. who knew that constructing and running an amusement park could be so much fun? view larger. rollercoaster tycoon 3 allows four modes of play: tutorial career sandbox and custom scenario. the tutorial mode lets you quickly learn and experiment with how to set up and make use of all the game elements. sandbox mode provides you with a large map and unlimited money and makes all the rides scenery shops and paths immediately available. this mode is great for just having fun and creating that super amusement park you've always wanted without worrying about game elements such as time limits. the custom scenario as the name suggests lets you set up your own rules and requirements using the game engine. you can share custom scenarios with friends or find ones that other people have created and posted online. the career mode that constitutes the main gameplay is a bit different than it has been in the past with three goal sets of increasing difficulty for each scenario. your job in career mode is to build the theme park of your dreams by accomplishing certain goals for each scenario. these goals can range from pleasing vips who like clean parks or coasters with certain excitement values to keeping a certain number of people referred to in the game as peeps in your park for a specific amount of time. your ultimate goal besides providing entertainment to all is to work your way from apprentice though entrepreneur and eventually reach the lofty heights of tycoon. rollercoaster tycoon 3 includes a host of nice-touch elements. there is a fireworks display as well as an editor that lets you customize your fireworks. you can add music that plays in time to certain rides or with your fireworks show. you can light up the night with a stunning park-wide lighting system or take in the breathtaking vistas as nature intended with realistic sunsets moonlight and more. there is even a coaster cam that puts you right in the action. you can take a front row seat on any of your rides and zoom along with a peep. (the camera does such an amazing job of showing you what your death spiral coaster feels like that you might not want to play until at least an hour after you've eaten.) and speaking of the pals -- they are completely personalized fully-animated individuals with unique facial expressions and behaviors. for example teenagers often run straight to the high-excitement level coasters while the younger kids like to stay on the more gentle rides and the older folks tend to complain and chase both sets of kids around. you can even create your own family members and friends and add them to your park where they will actually take pictures that will download directly to your my documents folder. there's also a lot of content to explore as rollercoaster tycoon 3 includes five separate themes including generic spooky western adventure and sci-fi. each theme has distinctive rides amusements and shops as well as animatronics and decorations. the game's sweeping variety lets you do virtually anything from setting up water rides that have mechanical great-white sharks lurching out of the water to creating a roller coaster straight out of your imagination. there are 18 distinct scenarios in the game with two that are only playable when unlocked. beating the apprentice level of difficulty on each of the initially unlocked scenarios will unlock a new scenario but you have to beat the much more difficult entrepreneur and tycoon settings on all the levels to unlock the final two scenarios. when it comes to the creative aspect of the game rollercoaster tycoon 3 will allow players to create some spectacular parks with a level of detail they're sure to love. if you were a fan of the first two versions you'll love this one. but if you never played the originals but love theme parks you owe it to yourself to give rollercoaster tycoon 3 a try.,aspyr media,49.99,architecture-centric software project management: a practical guide,architecture-centered software project planning (acspp) is an important software development methodology for planning software projects. by utilizing software architecture when managing projects practitioners experience better success completing ...,,39.59,b000ayxld4#http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/8362895978156173

information from other sources and in different ways other difficulties can arise. for instance because most people don't have a way of digitally capturing unstructured information they often print out web research and store information in file folders or on desks which is difficult to find later and inaccessible when you're away. and sharing information with others can be challenging--even when using e-mail it can be hard to hard to figure out what the plan is without reading through long e-mail threads that may or may not contain the information you need. onenote 2007 however gives you a

communication coordination and information sharing can challenge group effectiveness and productivity. teams often rely on e-mail messages to share information causing confusion and bloated e-mail
